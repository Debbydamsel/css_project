                My name is <b>ADEBERO OLUWAGBEMISOLA DEBORAH</b>.
                I am actually transitioning from the accounting world into the technology space because of my love for technology, I like the fact that through research, consistency and hard-work you can actually bring your ideas to life. The fact that one can also solve problems through technology is also another reason why i like technology.

               Css is known as an acronym for <b>CASCADING STYLE SHEETS</b>  and it is very important as it helps us to beautify our webpage(I am actaully using <b>CSS</b> to add the different colors that makes this website colorful, I also used css for the visible space inside the box which is called padding and also the space outside the box which is known as margin.) Without css, this webpage will be turn out to be boring and ugly. That is how important css is.

               I have actually learnt a lot in the last couple of weeks. I have learnt so much about <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b>. I know know that generally, HTML is the buliding block of the webpage and CSS is used to add styles or beautify our webpage. I can illustrate it by saying HTML is our house we built and css is the paint that is being applied to the house.
                
               <br>
               I learnt about the different tags that are there in HTML ranging from h1-h6, the paragraph tag which the p tag, i tag for italizing your text, the b tag for making your text bold(p.s: I used the b tag and the i tag for making the text bold and italized). 

               <br>

               I learnt about margin, padding borders in <b>CSS</b> which would be discussed about in the third section of this pageðŸ˜‰. I also learnt about specificity, inheritance(this talks about the children of a parent inheriting the properties of their parent)

                <b>PADDING</b> is the visible space that is inside the border while <b>MARGIN</b> is the sapce created outside the border and <b>BORDER</b> this is the visble box one sees when the border property(style, width, color) is added to css. As seen here, the blue dotted box camping the text is the border.
